# 📣 Overview

## MorphoBench

![MorphoBench Overview](./asset/MorphoBench.jpg)

MorphoBench is an adaptive reasoning benchmark for large-scale models. It curates over 1,300 multidisciplinary questions and dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on model reasoning traces, providing a scalable and reliable framework for evaluating the reasoning performance of advanced models like o3 and GPT-5.

# 🎓 Dataset

The MorphoBench dataset is available on Hugging Face: [OpenDCAI/MorphoBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench)

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("OpenDCAI/MorphoBench")
```

After downloading, create a data/ folder inside your local project directory and place the datasets there:
、、、

# ⚙️ Usage

## Environment Setup

、、、bash
cd Morphobench
pip install -r requirements.txt
、、、

## Run Inference

Generate model predictions for all datasets:
、、、bash
bash scripts/run_batch.sh
、、、

Predictions will be saved under:
、、、
output/infer_result/
、、、

## Evaluate Results

Evaluate the reasoning performance:
、、、bash
bash scripts/evaluate_batch.sh
、、、

Evaluation metrics will be stored in:
、、、
output/eval_result/
、、、
